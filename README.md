# How to run

You need an env variable for `MAL_CLIENT_ID` set to your MAL API's client ID. Otherwise, it takes two command line arguments:

1. Your MAL username (for finding which anime you have seen)
2. The voice actor's ID, which you can find by going to their page in MAL and looking at the URL.
